                <p>Place a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil on a warm, wet washcloth. Fold the washcloth over and
                    breathe in the vapors. Dropping some of the oil in the shower or bath creates a steambath that can
                    soothe irritated airways. Avoid this if you’re sensitive to eucalyptus or dislike the scent.</p>

                <div class="title">Cough and Sore throat</div>
                <p>Ingest a teaspoon of raw, locally sourced honey during a coughing fit or dilute it in hot water and
                    drink frequently to soothe inflamed tissues in the throat. (Not recommended for children under the
                    age of one year.)</p>

                <p>Ginger – helpful for upset stomach, nausea and motion sickness. Available as a tea (look for
                    medicinal brands), or try candied ginger when you’re on the go.
                    Probiotics – live bacteria and yeasts that are good for your digestive system. Probiotics can help
                    with diarrhea caused by infections or related to antibiotic use. Available as supplements and in
                    foods like yogurt, miso paste, kombucha, kimchi and raw sauerkraut. </p>

                <p>Tea – try chamomile tea in the evening as you are winding down.
                    Lavender – an aromatherapy oil used for calming and relaxation. Safe for both young children and

                <div class="title">Upset stomach</div>
                <p>Place a warm water bottle on belly and perform a “Hara” abdominal massage. Start at the bottom right
                    of your belly, move hands gently up under the right rib cage. Then move hands across to the left
                    under the rib cage, and move them down the left abdomen to the lower middle of the belly. Drinking
                    fennel, chamomile or licorice tea liberally will help soothe the stomach and aid hydration.</p>
